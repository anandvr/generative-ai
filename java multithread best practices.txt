java multithread best practices
The Executors class in java.util.concurrent provides utility methods for creating and managing thread pools. Thread pools are a more efficient way to manage threads compared to creating them explicitly. Here's an example of how to use Executors to create a simple fixed-size thread pool:

import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class ThreadPoolExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a fixed-size thread pool with 5 threads
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

        // Submit tasks to the thread pool
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            Runnable task = new MyTask(i);
            executor.submit(task);
        }

        // Shutdown the thread pool when all tasks are complete
        executor.shutdown();
    }

    static class MyTask implements Runnable {
        private final int taskId;

        MyTask(int taskId) {
            this.taskId = taskId;
        }

        @Override
        public void run() {
            System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is running on thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}
