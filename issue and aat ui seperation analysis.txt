 Functional Analysis
1.1. Module Features:

Identify all UI components (forms, pages, buttons) related to the Issues and Action Plan modules.
Determine the functionality required in the UI for both modules (e.g., issue creation, action plan tracking, updating, etc.).
Ensure that the user workflows (navigation, interactions, transitions) are clear and work independently.
1.2. User Roles and Permissions:

Identify which user roles access these modules and their permission levels.
Ensure that user roles, access control, and permission mapping will be correctly implemented in the separated UI.
2. UI Architecture and Design
2.1. UI Framework:

Analyze the frontend framework currently used (e.g., Angular, React) in OpenPages for the Issues and Action Plan modules.
Ensure the framework supports separation and can handle modular deployment.
2.2. Shared UI Components:

Identify any shared components (menus, navigation, headers) that are currently used in other parts of the OpenPages UI.
Determine if any of these components need to be recreated or adapted for the separated UI.
2.3. UI State Management:

Analyze how state management is handled (e.g., Redux, NgRx, context API) for Issues and Action Plan.
Ensure that the new UI can handle independent state management without relying on OpenPages.
3. Backend Interaction and API Integration
3.1. API Dependencies:

Identify all API calls made by the Issues and Action Plan UI to interact with the backend.
Ensure that APIs for creating, updating, deleting, and viewing issues and action plans are accessible independently.
3.2. Authentication and Authorization:

Verify the authentication mechanism used (e.g., OAuth, JWT) to ensure that the separated UI can handle user sessions independently.
Ensure authorization checks are handled correctly in the standalone UI.
3.3. Data Handling and Mapping:

Ensure proper data binding between the UI and backend API responses (e.g., mapping API responses to forms, tables).
Analyze how data validation and error handling are done in the current UI and plan for handling it in the separated version.
4. UI/UX Analysis
4.1. User Flow and Navigation:

Analyze the user journey through the Issues and Action Plan modules (e.g., navigation from one module to another).
Ensure that navigation works independently and smoothly without relying on other parts of OpenPages.
4.2. User Experience (UX):

Assess the current UX design (layout, interactions, responsiveness) and determine if any adjustments need to be made for the separated UI.
Ensure that the UI is intuitive and maintains the same user experience standards (loading times, accessibility, mobile responsiveness).
4.3. UI Consistency:

Maintain a consistent design language with the rest of the application (if applicable) or create a new design system for the separated modules.
Ensure styling and theming remain consistent, using either CSS, Sass, or frameworks like Bootstrap.
5. Data Dependencies and Reporting
5.1. Data Sources:

Analyze the data dependencies for UI components, ensuring that the required data (e.g., lists of issues or action plans) can be fetched independently from the backend.
Ensure data displayed in the UI (e.g., issue statuses, assigned users) is up-to-date and properly synchronized with the backend.
5.2. Reporting Interfaces:

Identify any UI components related to reporting that display issues or action plans in charts or tables.
Ensure that reporting functionalities continue to work post-separation (or plan to separate them if necessary).
6. Security and Compliance
6.1. Frontend Security:

Ensure security mechanisms are in place to handle vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and others.
Ensure input validation and data sanitization are handled in the new UI.
6.2. Data Privacy and Compliance:

Ensure the UI meets any required compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) related to data visibility and user interactions.
Verify that audit logs and user actions (if required) are maintained within the UI after separation.
7. Performance Considerations
7.1. Load Times and Optimization:

Analyze the load times of the current UI and identify ways to optimize the performance of the standalone modules.
Ensure efficient loading of resources (e.g., lazy loading, reducing HTTP requests, minimizing the size of JavaScript and CSS files).
7.2. Caching Mechanisms:

Implement caching strategies for UI elements (e.g., storing commonly accessed data in memory or using browser caching).
Ensure that caching doesnâ€™t compromise data freshness, particularly for issues and action plan statuses.
8. Testing and QA
8.1. Unit and Integration Testing:

Identify areas of the UI that need unit tests and integration tests for the separated modules.
Ensure that all frontend validation logic, API calls, and data binding are thoroughly tested.
8.2. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):

Plan for UAT to validate that the separated UI meets business and user requirements.
Include end-users in testing to ensure the new UI provides the expected functionality and usability.
8.3. Performance Testing:

Conduct performance tests on the standalone UI to measure load times, data fetching times, and UI responsiveness under various loads.
9. Deployment and DevOps
9.1. Deployment Pipeline:

Plan for setting up an independent deployment pipeline (CI/CD) for the separated UI, if not already in place.
Ensure that the build process (e.g., using Webpack, Docker) can handle the deployment of the standalone UI without dependencies on the rest of OpenPages.
9.2. Versioning and Releases:

Set up proper versioning for the separated UI so that updates and bug fixes can be managed independently.
Ensure a clear process for handling releases and rollbacks for the standalone UI.
10. Documentation and Training
10.1. Documentation for Developers:

Ensure that all technical documentation for the UI components, services, and dependencies is up to date and reflects the separation.
Provide guidelines for future developers to maintain and extend the standalone UI.
10.2. User Documentation and Training:

Provide user documentation for the new UI, especially if there are changes in navigation or functionality.
Prepare a training plan for end-users to get familiar with the separated modules.
