Subject: Inquiry: Load Balancing Support and Blue-Green Deployment in IBM DB2

Body:
Dear IBM DB2 Support Team,

We are exploring options to implement a setup similar to a web load balancer for our IBM DB2 database. Specifically, we want to:

Use a single logical database name to abstract the underlying physical servers.
Attach and detach physical database servers dynamically to support blue-green deployment without service disruption.
Could you confirm if IBM DB2 supports such a configuration? If yes:

What features or tools (e.g., Data Partitioning Feature, HADR, or others) enable this functionality?
Are there specific configurations or middleware required to implement this?
Is there any impact on application-level connections when attaching or detaching physical servers?
Your guidance on implementing this setup efficiently and any best practices would be greatly appreciated.
